# Python Bruteforce String Generation   
## Using the Cartersian Function

Got bored one day and decided to make a short bruteforce script on python. After doing some research and reading extremely complex source codes i came across the cartesian function and how it can be used to do this job. Pretty simple.

##### Read about the cartesian function here : [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)
